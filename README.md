## Installation

- **Windows**: Download the installer`.exe` or `.msi` from [releases](https://github.com/bjn7/Tau/releases) and run it.  
  If you encounter a Windows SmartScreen warning, itâ€™s because I haven't purchased a Microsoft code-signing certificate yet. The app is safe to use, as the source code is available for review, and you can also scan it with VirusTotal.

  To install:

  1. Click "More info."
  2. Click "Run anyway."

  Here's an example of the SmartScreen prompt:

- **Linux**: Download the `.AppImage` or `.deb` file from [releases](https://github.com/bjn7/Tau/releases) and install it.
- **macOS**: Download the `.dmg` file from [releases](https://github.com/bjn7/Tau/releases), then drag **Tau** to your Applications folder.

**TODO**

- [ ] Optimize code further
- [ ] Add backup option
